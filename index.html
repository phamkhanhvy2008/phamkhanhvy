So it just the collection of love letter to the passed legacy. </p>

      <br> <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text"> For real, I hate editing - it took so much time of the day, you know. I was struggling for months to learn how to replace a sky since I was scared that no one would agree to film with me in an empty street in the middle of nowhere. And I couldn’t express my happiness when I first got things right - even if it was just pixelated, it is fine. </p>
     <br> <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text"> Tada - still I didn’t know how to get rid of the pixel so far, Like I am dead in my soul. Until then, I still have to separate the day sky from other pieces of my video, which is a hell of a pain.  </p>
     <br> <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text"> How to get rid of the Sky again, when I brought up a white shirt for shooting in the holy white sky? I don’t know what should I do now, and hell yes I am stuck with a bunch of problems to solve. Should I use this one? </p>
     <br> <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text"> I just don’t know how will it react to my video, hope for the best of us all. I think maybe it will be fine - in a way.: </p>

      <br>
    <h4  align="center" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Day 33: </h4>
      <br> <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text"> So ... I had texted my team to get shoot in Vinhome Ocean Park 2. This is our calendar and I got ver proud of us trying to shoot all the things up in just two days, with two mornings for all the make up and real efford. The wig I had ordered in Shopee online, and the eyes cosmetic also. I tested on myself and it was safety enough to wear on my actor's face, luckily (the make-up took 2 hours to finish). I was satisfied, but my thought of me had made her into looking like a clown had haunted me since then as my actor's brother (oppsie - unpredictable guess, it was my actor's guardian) calling me for it. </p>
     <br> <p align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text"> I had tried to make fake bruise and blood by eyes powdered cosmetics and fake crying mark by mascrara and eyesliners. It looks rather fake, but I told myself this is the first time I had ever done this type of make-up and it is okay to get experimental with it. At last, I had used all the knowledge I had absorbed on Little Red Book (Xiaohongshu) about this topic to trying to make her look good. </p> 
      <br> <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text"> For the shooting, there is so many new things I got experimented with, first it was the track shot. I wasn't fast enough to track my actor to the exact point of her body (I want to track shoot attention to her torso), so I have to get my friend to shoot with me (the logistic man - Minh Thái)! He was taller than me and he is capable of shooting the shot, although it is not stabelized beforehand, but I could do that post-production so that's okay. He was also told me which shot is impractical (turned out my storyboard had more impractical camera shot than I known, for example is when I tried focus on the ear - close-up shoot, the wig moved even if it just a slight movement. We had to changed to burst-up.) </p>
     <br> <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text"> The next day - amend, I had prepared two cakes for the shoot, expecting my actor to fail at least once. Turned out she isn't eat it and just pose like she ate the cake by hand, ended up calling my script being so gross and time-taking to make. I said that was okay to shoot in the pose and not eating the cake with bare hand, and the result is we have to eat two cakes.  </p>

      <br>
    <h4  align="center" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Day 32: Actors </h4>
      <br> <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text"> I am not a socialisation kind of person so I don’t have many friends to interact with. I was desepẻated to find an actor for my project since my acting was like crap. (And my reason for my being shy in front of the camera) I even had to watch videos of how to act like I was scared and nervous to realise that my script was not even realistic at all. </p>
     <br> <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text"> (And this is one of the videos I watched to learn how to act while resting after the shoot) </p>
     <br> <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text"> (FOR REAL THIS IS MY FACE) </p>
    <br> <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text"> I am desperate to find an actor so I asked people to help me out. I post on different forums on Facebook, mostly at our school convention and other kind of social platforms. I remember being so terrified that I could not do anything but stare in front of my computer with drinks and cry because of no notification, and I suffered from managing to buy stuff and make up a calendar for the shoot. The irony is it was the Lunar New Year - Tet Holidays in our country, the time when family members gather and enjoy the moment of interacting with each other (I have none of those moments!).  </p>
     <br> <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text"> (I got called out for spam in a group to the point that my post was declined) </p>
    <br> <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text"> I finally got a person that wanted to shoot with me. This is quite coincidental and too far from my expectation - my character was a grown woman - which unfortunately in the outcome product, the character will not be age-accurate, but I got no choice - this is someone that wants to shoot with me. I was very grateful because of her.  </p>
     <br> <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text"> Also, I have a friend helping me with lighting and logistic support. He got quite of experience since he is from another media studies class in my school and he is in a boy group who alway filmed together when we were classmates in grade 9 and 10. I was so grateful because of his help too - and I just need an experienced man who could help me go through this project safely. </p>
     <br> <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text"> In conclusion, this is just me talking about how grateful am I to have these people. At least I won’t have to worry about if I need help with this project (Now I am just the manager, but I think maybe life will be easier that way). </p>

    <h4  align="center" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Day 31: </h4>
      <br> <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text"> So I had dumb found myself trying to procastinated my work, I finally decided to do something good for it: I ordered my props! Relection boards, corset, cakes, toy gun, corset by eyes make-up cosmetic. I found it was so lucky for me I had ordered before Lunar New Year in my country - which is the biggest shopping and sale season in my country, and I got tons of discount help me to pay for it. (It will be deliver to my house at least 4 days after Lunar New Year - 1st of January in Lunar Calendar, I think I got enough lucky money for that)</p>
     <br> <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text"> Imagine yourself trying to work all of it out and still struggle. My friends and peers had been planning to shoot before Lunar New Year, but I am now just staring at nowhere, asked myself whenther I should be the actor myself or I should ask my friend for emergency help. I think I will try myself first because maybe I could act according to my script as the director and screenwriter of my own project. (wish me luck) Oh, I forgot that I have my demo shot (without any sound modification or impacted editing because this is for my old script) </p>

      <br> <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text"> I got into a lot of mistake. I forgot my mini microphone - the one that could be attached on to the actors. Until I got to school and opened my bag, I realised that I forgot it at home. My friend had suggested me to used voice acting in post-production instead because we had changed the setting from the hall to the school cafeteria to stick to our original source, I had to agreed. He said that this is the plan B (for the character to argue about breaking up on the phone) because I had messed everything up for not bringing a microphone and that was the last day we have the opportunity to shoot. And we had to wait either, because there was 2 other groups also wants to shoot in that exact area.</p>
      <br> <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text"> I genuinely doesn't understand why he had changed to the cafeteria than to "stick to original source" either, but with me, the table and the chair looks so wacky and unprofessional for a cinematic scene like this, and I think that the hall still look better. I didn't suggest anything to him but just do as what he said, knowing that I am the wrong one from the start.</p>

      <br> <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text"> Who loved Whisplash? Prepare for my recreation of the infamous "Break up" scene.</p>
       <br> <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text"> Our class prepared for the new movie project. We are seperated to groups - it is better described as we sell ourselves and promote our value to other classmates in a hope of 'being hired'. I had a friend agree to work with me which I am so happy that he had offered me to work with him. This we can only shoot in school (as a teacher's test of our creativity in composition in a limited setting - especially in BRUTALISM architecture style of the school and we could not even change the uniform to our will because it will risk our 'behavioural point'. This let us test different setting of the school, insert our individualism through lighting (some even got heavy equipments, we don't). We also got limited time too - only during media study period or on our spare time in school to shoot. Just imagine how grateful we are after our teacher, after 2 bussiness days of shooting, said that we could do the editting at home! (We had shoot for 3 bussiness days.) </p>
      <br> <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text"> First, we decided to make our demo film in the top of our school hall. That hall let to nowhere so it was so rare to be noisy there - what a fortune. We had used that oportunity to shoot some demo shots of the scene. My teacher demanded us to not change dialogue of the script, every other things could be altered to our liking. So I and him had brought no drink and acting like we are confess in our office! I acted, but I found that i am not a good actor, my acting is so awkward as i am trying to act like a desprated girlfriend wants to keep her boyfriend in the relationship, and I was scared on the camera too. (I hated every part of my body) </p>
      <br> <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text"> We had tried to shot on my tripod that always tilted to the heavier side, and our shoot not always be aligned with our planned grid. I felt sad after shooting even we had shoot almost all scene, he too, even being angry to the point that he monologued to himself after that. I am freak out at working in group from now on. But filmaking is never a one-man job, and I have to do things to cope with this, as fast as possible. </p>

Although mostly short times and I realised that I will be back home less often, I still miss it - that feeling of return to your parents' arms. Wishing time stops forever, and I continue to be a child, I will not be worry of money and stuff. And I thought to myself in my girly part of myself that scared of the unknown - what if the concept of time stopping could be applied to this kind of places? </p>

      <br> <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text"> I have so many feeling attached with this place, but the hidden one often concerned of how capitalism had invaded individualism of each houses, making them no other than a shell for the paguroideas that could be easily left. Soulless, the brutalism in the painted layers of nobelity lifestyle that was so easy to face destruction, the precious assets had turned into products of mass production. In our country, there was a quote that affected our country low and middle classes's real estate perspective: "An cư lạc nghiệp" - settling down and establishing a career, connected the two things that maybe not as strongly connected are house and career as one - and people often judging what they could see first. This indirectly risen the need to prove one self, and real estate was benefit from this because it was the easiest definition to compare, create the superficiality masks for anyone so obssessed with social expectation. </p>

Their family was pretty mess up, abusive rather. The story following them being degraded themselves into making their relationship more and more toxicated. (The logline is: An abusive sister tried not to abuse and kill her brother after they left their abusive aunt who raised them after their parents’ death.)

I love the idea of alienated stuff of Vivarium - just one day I was listening to the summary of the film and got interested (I got spoiled - but after seeing the full film on youtube I still enjoyed it). I was immediately thinking of Vinhomes ocean park 2 - the new luxurious neighbourhood in Văn Hưng district, Hưng Yên province, Việt Nam. The new collumns of houses was also repeated in an uncanny way like the movie, so I thought of being so fascinated at my own horror product if I could make my own version of that film. </p>

The repeated green houses and superficially sky - maybe was post-shooting processses - made the location as otherworldly as never thought could be exist on Earth. Also the sudden appear baby boy was annotated in my idea notebook. (Logline of Vivarium: The film follows a couple who are forced to care for a mysterious humanoid creature while trapped in a strange, vivarium-like neighbourhood.)</p>

    <br>  <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text"> When talking about the director that I was impressed the most, I was so confused about if I should include Andrey Tarkovkhy and David Lynch as both - I got inspired by them equally. I have to choose one, this is hard. I got inspired by The Stalker and Eraserhead. But I think I got inspired by Tarkovsky more, other parts for Lorcan and his Vivarium. I love Andrey's ideology of the lack of color, as color in movie distracted people from the composition and plotline of the movie - it will only be used as a device for storytelling. As I saw in both movies of Lynch and Tarkovsky is the show, don't tell technique - the minimalism of dialogue, for us to slowly observe the movie as fine art, of what it was shown on screen that make movies difference from visual, static art, theater and literature but the mix of both. (Love David Lynch for all the drone sound) </p>

The scene was not focusing on the actions but rather on the sounds that are happening suggesting a certain enigma of what is running visually on the other part of the scene, hyping the curiosity in the audience.  It was the image that I was proud of the most - that it exceeded any of my expectations because the light from the TV on the sofa blended so well together that without any filter, it was still a great picture. Chiaroscuro was heavily applied to this picture, and sure the effected of it will be taken for apply again i the future. </p>

No, not because of the model, but the filter I applied on it that maybe could have been used better if I rather applied a vintage filter on my image in the first take. This is the last moment in the last arc - arc three when the mother had gone completely insane and killed the kid but unsuccessfully in real life - she thought she had murdered him and fainted, and in her dream, the boy maniacally laughed at her for doing so and her seeing him in a yellow filter, more and more vivid on each stab she stabbed on him. Yellow, as lemon juice, and lemon is the mother's perspective of her son - she envies that her son could freely do things that she couldn't do due to her being a single mom that she couldn't deny, and he is the most acerbity thing she ever tasted throughout her life.</p>

   <br>  <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text"> <b> A hypothetical project that will never be made. </b> </p>
   <br> <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text">  Let just thinking about the first time you - instead of taking landscape photos, you choose to include them with people. How does it feel? Horrible right? It was me, facing my first ever media project as an always-assuming-to-be-a-writer. Only with my phone and my nervousness about socialisation, I am good to go. </p>
   <br> <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text">  I chose Experimental, Drama, Psychological, Horror and Thriller for the hypothetical movie project - it is the most comfortable genre for a beginner like me. It is about a woman who tried to provide for her son with her unstable mental health of postpone depression, she always saw her son as an obstacle she needed to get rid of after she got assaulted but couldn't get rid of him herself, and decided to treat him normally like how the media portrayed - a mother - along with a feeling that she is not belong to this world because she could not love the child. But she could not fully control herself and being manipulated by her anger and madness increased years and years without anyone to share, and to the point that she thought she killed her son and drown herself in her unbearable craziness. The project's title is The Lemon I Dropped on the Tree - as the mother associated her son with a bitter lemon that she dropped, and she tried to put it on the tree like normal since she is not ready to take it yet.</p>
   <br> <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text">  The movie title? Oh, I just made up within maybe seconds. But the plot? Only god knows how long. I was planning to shoot based on the storyboard I made up on Day 2 with my made-up storyline, and then post it on the blog for the done-of-business, but if the movie didn't have its title, it didn't consider one. Just a picture met my goal in the storyboard on the second day - which is great, because art making process is always unpredictable. In each picture will have it own enigma - I found that I am not used to describe my work as deep as this before. </p>

    <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text">  I kinda love this picture, although I planned to picture it in the evening. I choose the first still picture (for the opening scene of the hypothetical movie) to be inspired by Perfect Blue - a movie by Satoshi Kon about a singer who changes her career path to be an actor and walks into her insanity corridor of existential crisis after finding out that she is being stalked and the reason is her job-hopping - because it was the biggest inspiration for the plot and I want to indicate that. This was a reference to the highway train scene. I used a high-angle shot, not to show the character to introduce the era and the atmosphere of the film and also to symbolize the main character's feeling of not fitting in with people around her. The eerie blue of sadness sets down the character's view of life as lifeless and full of sadness. </p>

   <br>    <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text">  The second picture was in Act 1 also but after the opening scene. It was about the main character when she cooked dinner for her son. It was intended for the woman to be blocked by the surrounding stairway and the war, indicating herself as she is inside a cage that she made up by her own humane and by society's opinions. Using green as the colour of growth - and cooking had been seen as a symbol of it, but the colour tone made up a nostalgic yet uncomfortable feeling (of an alert of toxicity and bitterness) as this was through the eyes of her son when looking toward her. The black nylon layers covering the window, though it's not an intentional objects but made up of a feeling of losing the concept of time - seeing everything as dark, and gloomy. </p>

   <br> <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text">  School is a familiar place with me, but I don't want to link my film with the school atmosphere whatsoever. , my school is rather a high-class place with the average middle-class Vietnamese citizens and it has a different culture of study compare to public schools. It didn't reflect my sight - telling the story that our current life is what they haven't even thought of. Filming at school creates an invisible limit in ideas: people will too cling into it that it will devaluate their project - since every project looks the same. </p>

    <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text">  Binary opposition is an important part to hook audience to the film. This appears as early as human know how to tell a story with words, in the most basic genre: Superhero - with the good versus the evil, the weak versus the strong. Nowadays, it was even more complex, neither good nor bad, for example, the film “Vivre sa Vie” (1962) by Jean-Luc Godard is about the tied life that you are currently in with responsibilities as the social - choose to conform - but easier to survive or a more challenging one with an abstracted future, but you think it will be better for you in the future - people could said you are reckless. I was interested in movies talking about breaking the machine, crossed the line, becoming deviant and the consequences, whether a good ending or not is on the end of the road and the movie that brought me into it was The Matrix, then 1984 and The Truman Show. It was the topic that every human being ever asked themselves once in a lifetime, even if it was just a thought passing by.</p>
    <br> <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text">  The binary opposition that I want to address in the three topics in a family - parental or sibling relationship: over-indulgent vs abusive, love vs hate and awaken vs insanity. In the opening scene, it was the 2 first binary oppositions that took part in the plot. A reason why I so interested in it is the moment read a book about the psychology of the abusive and their victims: the abusive one could make a great first impression on the victim as a perfect lover for instance, but then when living together, the abusive will use violence against the victim, and after that apologizes the victim and overindulged the victim as a way to gaslight - the circle then repeated. The abuser and the victim both crossed the line of a healthy relationship but they lied to themselves that they are not. I want to explore that in a sibling relationship as a reflection of the relationship between my brother and me.</p>

    <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text"> As the one had addicted to tension through silence in movies and games, I want to minimise non-diegetic sound to the least - that means it will be mostly diegetic sound. I think non-diegetic sound - such as a score, or a voice-over - could be used at the beginning of the movie (like before or in the credit part when they introduce the directors, writers, producers and the movie title) as a way to settle the mood for the beginning of the film.</p>
      <br> <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text"> Maboroshi, Eraserhead, Fight Club, In the Mood for Love and Raise the Red Lantern are my inspirations for using sound. In the Mood for Love is the biggest inspiration for the diegetic sound - the recreation of the atmosphere of a typical 80s apartment in Taiwan and East Asia in general. Vietnamese residential areas for the low and middle class had the same atmosphere too, and I want to duplicate it in my project. </p>
      <br> <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text">  Fight Club - on the other hand - is the inspiration for the voice-over in the opening scene, as the narrator introduces us to his life before he is tied up by Tyler Durden and comments about it, the criticism about overconsumerism which is the whole theme of the movie. </p>
      <br> <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text">  There was a crazy idea in my head: I would use a separate microphone to record characters dialogues (the mini microphone that could be attached to clothes) and a different one to record the environment sound (might be the camera), and choosing what sound we want by separate each sound and edit them together on the software - to make the sound as realistic but also romantic in the final product.</p>

    <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text">  I was inspired by mostly movies and art throughout my creative journey. Mostly Western movies - I am not the kind of person who consumes a chunk of films but enjoys watching alone and eating popcorn. I found that I like drama - the kind that I could find beautiful melodies from composers, props and characters that are intentionally and artistically settled by the directors, and its way of storytelling will keep the audiences rewatching and analysing the dialogue to understand its layers of meaning. Maboroshi left the biggest impression on me in my creative journey and changed my direction from being a comic artist to a role linked with cinema. Because of its cinematography, the story of a woman who could not overcome the sadness of losing her previous husband even after remarrying and how the film's plot line breaks the norms of a loss story will direct the character into finding a way to heal their mentally ill spirit and succeed like in Eat, pray, love.</p>
          <br><p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text">   I was inspired much by the voiceover from Fight Club for the opening scene - a non-diegetic sound - but then shown to be a diegetic sound by the character putting off her earphones as I was inspired by the opening scene of Perfect Blue. The voice-over part will emulate the slow zoom from the face to the background from Coppola's The Godfather - the first part for the start of the opening scene. It will make the introduction of a character and the genre of the movie simultaneously, and also raise the dramatic set of the film from the start - the character is introduced to the war. </p>
      <br><p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text">  I want the camera set to be like Zhang Yimou's "Raise the Red Lantern" as Songlian walks inside her husband's mansion as it is closed, creating an intense atmosphere like you are in a prison. I want my project to always have some tension in even the happiest scene. </p>
         <br><p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text">  The opening plot is going to be a metaphor for the future plot like Maboroshi from Hirokazu Kore-eda. In the opening of the movie, the grandma of the husband says she wants to die in her hometown without any reason no matter how her granddaughter tries to prevent her from doing so, and in the end, the granddaughter lets go - which tells us that this story is related to death the mourning of those who are alive. </p>

    <p align="center" class="text" style="color: black;"> Storyboard of my camera project. </p>
    <br> <p align="center" class="text" style="color: black;"> I had created a storyboard for my camera project to visualise the overall project. I got inspired by the use of color of Wong Kar Wai (2nd image camera set - In the mood for love & color - happy together). I got the most influenced is the style of 80s-90s anime use of color and camera settle. (1st - camera set - inspired by Perfect Blue of Satoshi Kon), and games too - Devotion from Red Candle (3rd - the use of color, idea) and the use of yellowish color and art of Banksy (he is a public artist) for the 4nd picture.  </p>
      <br>
      <br> <p align="center" class="text" style="color: black;"> Because of the Yagi storm and IELTS exam practice, I had a difficult time trying to find the right time, even I had the location. I was too nervous to take a photo in public, so I asked my family members to be my model. </p>
      <br> <p align="center" class="text" style="color: black;">I had used my phone (Realme C35) to take the photo - although with people it was one of the worst cameras on the phone ever except for a feature phone, that is everything I got, I had no problem with it since I had never been used to a high-end quality camera before. I opened the camera app and set it to the 3 grids-filter, flipped the phone horizontally and ran out to look for places. I was humbled that finally, I had a chance to use what I had learned on Studiobinder (I had subscribed to their channel but mostly for how to build a plot only and rarely looking at how to film with a camera) to practice - but turn out it was not. The unstable of the bus was inevitable, and the setting of the light wasn't like what I had planned.</p>
         <br> <p align="center" class="text" style="color: black;"> I used filter a lot because I don't know how to do the light with limited bugget, mostly through the art app named Krita. I tried with cold pallete and hot one too, but turn out that I don't know how to use these hot color effectively. I was tried different filter, and found that not every filter - although look quite artistic, but not really practical when making a cinematic movie and it lead me to a change of genre for the final product than what I was planning: to not include surrealism. I found that technology is one of my weakness. But what I knew is the technology will be better, even better.</p>

    <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text"> This is my first time writing a blog. I had deduced a conclusion: freely making what you want to display from scratch is more challenging than using the basic assets, but the curiosity and the need to create something true to my vision had led me to dare the unknown. </p>
    <br>     <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text"> I started A-level media studies after just watching the opening scene of "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly." - as the fast-paced, camera and violent plot inspired me and led me to the world of media itself. I was also inspired by the artists who were influenced by movies and want to study how can they apply cinematic storytelling to their projects: Satoshi Kon, Hirohiko Araki, Tatsumoto, etc. I am a thriller and drama fan and enjoy grotesque artwork whatever the form it is ( I love Junji Ito's art, H.R. Giger's designs of biomechanism and David Lyncher's character design for his short works on YouTube)

    <br>     <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text"> I was impressed by films randomly suggested to me by Netflix or Mubi, as those are the two only live-streaming services I could reach. About Netflix, I am interested in the Society of the Snow and All Quiet at the West Front - which was awarded an Oscar; Pluto, Forest Gump, Fight Club. In Mubi, fantastic planet was what attracted me the most. I was introduced to Wong Kar Wai films: Happy Together, Chunking Express and In the Mood of Love. Raise the Red Lanterns was there too. </p>
    <br>     <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text"> All of the movie I watched had led me to the world of arts: niche - or experimental - film, to drown myself in the story that the screenwriters and the directors had created. </p>
