    <p align="center" class="text" style="color: black;"> Storyboard of my camera project. </p>
    <br> <p align="center" class="text" style="color: black;"> I had created a storyboard for my camera project to visualise the overall project. I got inspired by the use of color of Wong Kar Wai (2nd image camera set - In the mood for love & color - happy together). I got the most influenced is the style of 80s-90s anime use of color and camera settle. (1st - camera set - inspired by Perfect Blue of Satoshi Kon), and games too (3rd - the use of color, idea) and the use of yellowish color and art of Banksy for the 4nd picture.  </p>

    <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text">This is my first time writing a blog to be assume. I had deduced a conclusion: to be freely making what you want to display from scratch is more challenging than using the basic assets, but daring the unknown is my style.  </p>
    <br>     <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text"> I started Alevel media studies after watching the opening scene of "The good, the bad and the ugly." - as the fast-pace, camera and violent plot inspired me and let me to the world of media itself. I was also aspired by the artists that were influenced by movies: Satoshi Kon, Hirohiko Araki, Tatsumoto,... </p>

    <p align="center" class="text" style="color: black;"> Society of the Snow. </p>
    <br>     <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text"> I got impressed by films randomly suggested to me by Netflix or Mubi too, as that are two only livestreaming services I could reach. About Netflix, I am interested in the Society of the Snow, Pluto, Forest Gump, Fight Club and All quiet at the West Front. </p>
    <br>     <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text">In Mubi, fantastic planet was what attracted me the most. I was introduced to Wong Kar Wai film: Happy Together, Chunking Express and In the mood of Love. Raise the red lanterns was there too. </p>
    <br>     <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text"> All of the movie I watched had led me to the world of art: niche - or experimental - film, to drown myself to the story that the screenwriters and the directors had created. </p>
