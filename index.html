    <p align="center" class="text" style="color: black;"> Storyboard of my camera project. </p>
    <br> <p align="center" class="text" style="color: black;"> I had created a storyboard for my camera project to visualise the overall project. I got inspired by the use of color of Wong Kar Wai (2nd image camera set - In the mood for love & color - happy together). I got the most influenced is the style of 80s-90s anime use of color and camera settle. (1st - camera set - inspired by Perfect Blue of Satoshi Kon), and games too (3rd - the use of color, idea) and the use of yellowish color and art of Banksy for the 4nd picture.  </p>

      <br> <p align="center" class="text" style="color: black;"> Because of the Yagi storm and IELTS exam practice, I had a difficult time trying to find the right time, even I had the location.</p>
      <br> <p align="center" class="text" style="color: black;">I had used my phone (Realme C35)  to take the photo - although with people it was one of the worst camera on the phone ever except for a feature phone, that is everything I got, I had no problem with it since I had never been used to a high-end quality camera before. I opened the camera app and set it to the 3 grids-filter, flipped the phone horizontally and ran out to look for places. I was humbled that finally I had a chance to use what I had leant on Studiobinder to practice - but turn out it was not. The unstable of the bus was inevitable, and the setting of the light wasn't like what I was planned.</p>

    <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text"> This is my first time writing a blog. I had deduced a conclusion: freely making what you want to display from scratch is more challenging than using the basic assets, but the curiosity and the need to create something true to my vision had led me to dare the unknown. </p>
    <br>     <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text"> I started A-level media studies after just watching the opening scene of "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly." - as the fast-paced, camera and violent plot inspired me and led me to the world of media itself. I was also inspired by the artists who were influenced by movies and want to study how can they apply cinematic storytelling to their projects: Satoshi Kon, Hirohiko Araki, Tatsumoto, etc. I am a thriller and drama fan and enjoy grotesque artwork whatever the form it is ( I love Junji Ito's art, H.R. Giger's designs of biomechanism and David Lyncher's character design for his short works on YouTube)

    <p align="center" class="text" style="color: black;"> Society of the Snow - Netflix. </p>
    <br>     <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text"> I was impressed by films randomly suggested to me by Netflix or Mubi, as those are the two only live-streaming services I could reach. About Netflix, I am interested in the Society of the Snow and All Quiet at the West Front - which was awarded an Oscar; Pluto, Forest Gump, Fight Club. In Mubi, fantastic planet was what attracted me the most. I was introduced to Wong Kar Wai films: Happy Together, Chunking Express and In the Mood of Love. Raise the Red Lanterns was there too. </p>
    <br>     <p  align="center"  style="color: black;" class="text"> All of the movie I watched had led me to the world of arts: niche - or experimental - film, to drown myself in the story that the screenwriters and the directors had created. </p>
